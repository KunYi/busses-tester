<h1>SPI Interface</h1>

<p>The SPI tester is a device to help with testing SPI master interfaces, APIs, and drivers. The test device implements a series of commands that the master can use to verify functionality of the host interface. The test device enables</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verification of data transmitted by the master. The test device computes a checksum of all received data which the master can compare against its own checksum.</li>
  <li>Verification that data received by the master is correct. The tester will send sequential data to the master with a configurable starting value, which the master can use to detect out of sequence bytes.</li>
  <li>Verification of different connection settings, including all SPI modes, data bit lengths from 4 to 16, and clock speeds up to 5Mhz.</li>
  <li>Verification of SPI clock frequency</li>
  <li>Detection of gaps between bytes in a transfer</li>
  <li>Simulation of an interrupt driven device and interrupt latency measurements</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the benefits of the SPI tester are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Based on inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware (mbed LPC1768)</li>
 <li>No drivers required to program firmware - simply drag and drop firmware to device</li>
 <li>Self-contained protocol - no USB connection between host and test device</li>
</ul>

## Interface Description

The device acts as a slave on the SPI bus and implements a set of commands. The master interacts with the device by sending commands, and using the responses to those commands to verify properties of the master. Responses sent by the tester include a checksum which the master can use to validate the received bytes.

All code references in the following description refer to symbols in the `Lldt::Spi` namespace, unless otherwise noted. The interface is defined in `lldtester.h`.

### GetDeviceInfo Command

Get information about the test device.

Usage:

 1. Write a `CommandBlock` structure with `Command` set to `SpiTesterCommand::GetDeviceInfo`
 2. Read `TesterInfo` structure

## CaptureNextTransfer Command

Enter capture mode. In capture mode, all bytes received by the tester will be added to a CRC16 which can be queried by the master after the capture is complete. The tester will send sequential values (e.g. fd fe ff 0 1 2 ...) that the host can use to validate the master's read functionality. The capture lasts for the duration of the next transfer (falling edge of CS to rising edge of CS), and the tester will enter idle mode after leaving capture mode. The master should then issue the `GetTransferInfo` command to get information about the captured transfer.

Usage:

 1. Send the `CaptureNextTransfer` command. See below for a description of the input buffer.
 2. Perform the transfer under test, using the connection settings you specified in the CaptureNextTransfer input buffer.
 3. Send the `GetTransferInfo` command to get information about the captured transfer.

### Input Buffer

The input buffer is described by the `CommandBlock` structure. The `CommandBlock.u.CaptureNextTransfer` member contains parameters that control the behavior of capture mode.

  </tr>
</table>

## StartPeriodicInterrupts Command

Send this command to enter periodic interrupt mode. In periodic interrupt mode, the tester brings a GPIO pin LOW on a regular interval, and will wait for the receipt of an `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command before setting the pin high again. The `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command contains the time between when the GPIO pin was asserted and the `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command was received, which the host interface can use to measure interrupt latency. The tester also keeps track of statistics during periodic interrupt mode including the number of acknowledgements received before the deadline, the number of acknowledgements received after the deadline, and the number of twice-acknowledged interrupts.

The tester will remain in periodic interrupt mode for the duration specified in the command. If a command other than `AcknowledgeInterrupt` is received while in periodic interrupt mode, the device will immediately exit periodic interrupt mode and enter idle mode. After interrupt mode is exited, the master should issue the `GetPeriodicInterruptInfo` command to retrieve information about the most recent interrupt session.

### Input Buffer

The input buffer is described by the `CommandBlock` structure. The `CommandBlock.u.StartPeriodicInterrupts` member contains parameters that control the behavior of interrupt mode.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Byte Offset</th>
    <th>Name</th>

    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Command</td>
    <td>uint8_t</td>
    <td>The command code. Must be set to `SpiTesterCommand::StartPeriodicInterrupts`</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1-4</td>
    <td>InterruptFrequency</td>
    <td>uint32_t</td>
    <td>The rate at which to generate interrupts in Hz. A falling edge will be produced on the interrupt pin this many times per second.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5-6</td>
    <td>DurationInSeconds</td>
    <td>uint16_t</td>
    <td>How long to generate interrupts in seconds. The total number of interrupts generated will be InterruptFrequency * DurationInSeconds</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The total number of interrupts generated as given by `InterruptFrequency * DurationInSeconds` must be less than or equal to `UINT32_MAX`.

## AcknowledgeInterrupt Command

While in periodic interrupt mode, this command should be sent to acknowledge an interrupt. The `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command is different than other commands in that its issued as a single write-read transfer, whereas the other commands are sent as a write transfer, then a read transfer, with the chip select line asserted and deasserted for each transfer. The `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command requires the chip select line to remain asserted during both the write and read portions of the transfer.

Usage:

Issue a WriteRead, where the Write portion of the transfer is `sizeof(CommandBlock)` bytes in length and the read portion of the transfer is `sizeof(AcknowledgeInterruptInfo)` bytes in length. Each byte in the write portion of the transfer should be set to `SpiTesterCommand::AcknowledgeInterrupt`. The `AcknowldgeInterruptInfo` structure is described below.

### Input Buffer

The 8-byte write portion of the `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command must have each byte set to `SpiTesterCommand::AcknowledgeInterrupt`.

### Output Buffer

The read portion of the `AcknowledgeInterrupt` command is described by the `AcknowledgeInterruptInfo` structure.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Byte Offset</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0-3</td>

    <td>uint32_t</td>
    <td>The number of ticks (in units of ClockMeasurementFrequency ticks per second) that elapsed since the interrupt pin was asserted to the first falling edge of SCK since the interrupt. If TimeSinceFallingEdge is <code>INVALID_TIME_SINCE_FALLING_EDGE</code> it means the interrupt was already acknowledged, and the latency calculation would be invalid.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4-7</td>
    <td>Checksum</td>
    <td>uint32_t</td>
    <td>This will be set to the bitwise NOT of TimeSinceFallingEdge, and can be used to verify that validity of the response.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## GetPeriodicInterruptInfo Command

This command should be sent after periodic interrupt mode is exited to retrieve information about the interrupt session.

Usage:

 1. Write a `CommandBlock` with the Command member set to `SpiTesterCommand::GetInterruptInfo`. 
 1. Read a `PeriodicInterruptInfo` structure

 - **NotAcknowledged** An invalid command was received while in periodic interrupt mode. The only command that is valid in periodic interrupt mode is the AcknowledgeInterrupt command. Any other command will cause an exit from periodic interrupt mode.
 - **IncompleteReceive** The chip select line was deasserted before the entire AcknowledgeInterrupt command could be received. This error will cause periodic interrupt mode to be exited. 
 - **IncompleteTransmit** The chip select line was deasserted before all response data to the AcknowledgeInterrupt command could be sent. This error will not cause periodic interrupt to be exited. 
 - **TransmitUnderrun** The transmit FIFO could not be serviced in time while transmitting data, meaning that data read by the master is likely invalid. This error does not cause an exit from periodic interrupt mode. 
 - **ArithmeticOverflow** The specified duration and frequency would result in a total number of interrupts that would exceed the range of a uint32_t. Use a lower frequency or duration.
